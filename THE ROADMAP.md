Okay, this is an ambitious but potentially transformative 30-day plan. It's fantastic that you recognize the gap and want to build a solid foundation while simultaneously applying your learning. Relying heavily on AI without understanding the underlying principles is indeed a risky long-term strategy.

Let's break this down. Your primary goal is **understanding your current Next.js/TypeScript work codebase** to gain independence from AI for edits. Your secondary, intertwined goal is **building a specific AI SaaS** (Company News Agent & NEPSE Summary Poster) using Next.js, TypeScript, FastAPI, Supabase, and Langchain/LangGraph, thereby solidifying your learning.

**Core Challenges & Mindset:**

1. **Time Constraint:** College (6-10 am), Work (approx. 11:30 am - 3:30 pm), leaves you roughly 4-6 hours _maximum_ dedicated learning/building time daily, plus weekends. This is _tight_ for the breadth and depth you're aiming for.
2. **Context Switching:** You want to learn JS, TS, Python, React, Next.js, FastAPI, Supabase, Langchain, _and_ analyze existing code _and_ build a new app _and_ practice soft skills, all "side-by-side." This requires discipline to avoid getting overwhelmed.
3. **Fundamental Gap:** You need to go back to basics _while_ working with advanced concepts. This means relating fundamental concepts directly to how they are used in your stack.
4. **Breaking AI Reliance:** This is key. When stuck, your _first_ instinct must be to debug, research docs, and _try_ solutions yourself _before_ asking AI. Embrace the struggle; it's where learning happens.

**Overarching Strategy:**

- **Deconstruct & Reconstruct:** Spend dedicated time _daily_ analyzing your work codebase. Start small (one component, one function). Understand its purpose, how it gets data, how it manages state, and _try_ to make a minor modification _yourself_.
- **Fundamentals -> Application:** Learn a fundamental concept (e.g., JavaScript Promises, React `useEffect`, Python classes) and immediately find where it's used in your work code or apply it in your SaaS project.
- **SaaS as a Sandbox:** Use the SaaS project to actively practice _every_ new concept you learn. Don't just read about Supabase auth; implement it. Don't just learn FastAPI routing; build an endpoint.
- **Timeboxing:** Allocate specific blocks of time for different activities (e.g., 1 hour work code analysis, 1.5 hours fundamental learning + SaaS application, 30 mins skill practice).
- **Atomic Habits:** Small, consistent daily actions are key. Write _something_ short daily (even just summarizing what you learned), explain a concept out loud, try one simple coding challenge.

**Detailed Learning Topics Breakdown (Beyond `useState`/`useEffect`):**

**JavaScript (Foundation):**

- **Core:** Variables (`var`, `let`, `const`), Data Types (primitives, objects), Operators, Control Flow (if/else, loops), Functions (declarations, expressions, arrow functions), Scope (global, function, block), Closures.
- **Asynchronous JS:** Callbacks, Promises (`.then`, `.catch`, `.finally`), `async`/`await`. Crucial for fetching data.
- **ES6+ Features:** Array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `find`, `forEach`), Destructuring, Spread/Rest operators, Modules (`import`/`export`).
- **DOM Manipulation (Basic understanding):** How JS interacts with HTML (though React abstracts this).

**TypeScript (Superset of JS):**

- **Core Types:** `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `array`, `object`, `any`, `unknown`, `void`, `null`, `undefined`.
- **Type Annotations:** Typing variables, function parameters, and return values.
- **Interfaces & Types:** Defining shapes for objects.
- **Generics:** Creating reusable typed components/functions.
- **Enums:** Defining sets of named constants.
- **Type Inference:** How TS figures out types automatically.
- **Utility Types:** `Partial`, `Required`, `Readonly`, `Pick`, `Omit`, etc.

**React (UI Library):**

- **Core Concepts:** Components (Functional primarily), JSX syntax, Props (passing data down), State (`useState`).
- **Hooks:**
    - `useState`: Managing component-local state.
    - `useEffect`: Handling side effects (data fetching, subscriptions, timers, manual DOM mutations). Understand its dependency array _deeply_.
    - `useContext`: Managing global state or avoiding prop drilling.
    - `useRef`: Accessing DOM nodes directly or storing mutable values that don't cause re-renders.
    - `useMemo`, `useCallback`: Optimization hooks (understand _when_ and _why_ to use them, often later).
    - Custom Hooks: Creating reusable stateful logic.
- **Conditional Rendering:** Showing/hiding UI elements.
- **Lists and Keys:** Rendering dynamic lists correctly.
- **Component Lifecycle (in functional components via Hooks):** Mounting, updating, unmounting.

**Next.js (React Framework):**

- **Routing:** App Router (recommended) vs. Pages Router. File-based routing, dynamic routes, layouts, `loading.js`, `error.js`.
- **Rendering:** Server Components (default in App Router), Client Components (`'use client'`), understanding the difference and when to use each.
- **Data Fetching:**
    - Server Components: Direct `async`/`await` `Workspace`.
    - Client Components: `useEffect`, or libraries like TanStack Query (React Query).
    - Server Actions: Executing server-side code directly from client components (useful for mutations).
- **API Routes:** Creating backend endpoints within your Next.js app (though you're also using FastAPI).
- **Metadata & SEO:** `metadata` object, `generateMetadata` function.
- **Deployment:** Vercel specifics (environment variables, build process).

**TanStack Query (React Query):**

- **Core Concepts:** Queries (`useQuery`), Mutations (`useMutation`), Query Keys, Caching, Stale-While-Revalidate, Invalidation, Prefetching.
- **Usage with `Workspace` or Supabase client.**
- Understand _why_ it's used over simple `useEffect` for server state (caching, background updates, performance).

**Tailwind CSS:**

- **Core Concepts:** Utility-first approach, basic syntax.
- **Configuration:** `tailwind.config.js` (theming, custom classes).
- **Directives:** `@tailwind`, `@apply`, `@layer`.
- **Responsive Design:** Using prefixes like `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`.
- **States:** `hover:`, `focus:`, `active:`.
- **Dark Mode.**

**Python (Foundation for FastAPI):**

- **Core:** Syntax, Data Types (int, float, str, list, tuple, dict, set), Control Flow, Functions, Classes (basic OOP), Modules/Packages (`import`).
- **Virtual Environments:** `venv` or `conda`.
- **Package Management:** `pip`.
- **Basic File I/O.**

**FastAPI (Python Web Framework):**

- **Core Concepts:** `FastAPI` instance, Path Operations (`@app.get`, `@app.post`, etc.), Path & Query Parameters.
- **Request Body:** Using Pydantic models for data validation and serialization.
- **Response Model:** Defining the shape of the response.
- **Async/Await:** Handling asynchronous operations (crucial for I/O like DB calls or external APIs).
- **Dependency Injection:** Managing dependencies (like database connections).
- **Error Handling:** `HTTPException`.
- **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):** If your Next.js app calls FastAPI from the browser.
- **Deployment:** DigitalOcean (Docker, App Platform).

**Supabase (Backend as a Service):**

- **Dashboard:** Navigating the UI.
- **Auth:** User sign-up, sign-in (email/password, OAuth), session management. Row Level Security (RLS) basics â€“ critical for security.
- **Database:** Creating tables, defining columns/types, understanding relationships (foreign keys). Writing basic SQL `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` queries (Supabase client library often abstracts this but understanding SQL helps).
- **Supabase Client (`supabase-js`):** Using the library in Next.js for Auth and DB operations.
- **Edge Functions:** Writing serverless functions (Deno/TypeScript) that run close to the user. Understanding their use cases (e.g., secure API calls, webhooks, tasks not suitable for client-side). Caching within Edge Functions.
- **Storage:** Storing files (if needed).
- **Realtime:** Subscribing to database changes (for instant UI updates).

**Langchain / LangGraph (AI Orchestration):**

- **Core LLM Concepts:** Prompts, completions, embeddings, vector stores.
- **Langchain:**
    - Models: Interfacing with LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).
    - Prompts: Prompt templates, managing prompts.
    - Chains: Combining LLMs and prompts (`LLMChain`). Sequential chains.
    - Document Loaders: Loading data from various sources (web pages, PDFs).
    - Text Splitters: Breaking down large documents.
    - Embeddings & Vector Stores: Creating vector representations of text and storing/querying them (e.g., Supabase `pgvector`).
    - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Combining retrieval from vector stores with LLM generation (core for your news research agent).
    - Agents & Tools: Giving LLMs access to tools (like search APIs, database lookups, your FastAPI endpoints).
- **LangGraph:** Building stateful, multi-actor applications (more complex agents). Start with Langchain basics first.

**Development Practices:**

- **Git:** Branching, committing, merging, pull requests. Use it for _everything_.
- **Debugging:** Browser DevTools (Network tab, Console, Source), `console.log`/`print`, FastAPI interactive docs (`/docs`), VS Code debugger.
- **Environment Variables:** Managing secrets and configurations (`.env`).

**Soft Skills / Habits:**

- **Article Writing:** Summarize daily learnings or explain a concept simply.
- **Speaking:** Explain code/concepts out loud (rubber duck debugging) or to a friend/colleague.
- **Video:** Record short clips of yourself coding or explaining something (optional, but good practice).
- **LeetCode (Optional but helpful):** Focus on Easy/Medium problems using JS/TS and Python to build fundamental problem-solving muscles. 1-2 per week is fine.

**Important Considerations:**

- **Be Flexible:** This schedule is a template. If you get stuck on a concept, spend more time on it. If you finish early, move ahead.
- **Prioritize Understanding Work Code:** If time is tight, prioritize the daily work code analysis and relating fundamental concepts to it over pushing new SaaS features.
- **Don't Aim for Perfection:** The goal is significant _progress_ in understanding and capability within 30 days, not absolute mastery or a flawless, production-ready SaaS.
- **Use Official Documentation:** MDN for JS, TypeScript Handbook, React Docs, Next.js Docs, FastAPI Docs, Supabase Docs, Langchain Docs are your best friends.
- **Version Control:** Use Git meticulously. Create branches for experimenting on your work code and for features/fixes in your SaaS. Commit often.
- **Health:** Don't skip meals, get enough sleep (crucial for learning!), and take short breaks during your study blocks. Avoid burnout. This pace is intense.
- **Celebrate Small Wins:** Acknowledge when you finally understand a concept or fix a bug yourself!

This is a challenging but rewarding path. By focusing on fundamentals, applying them immediately, and consistently analyzing existing code, you can make substantial progress in 30 days towards your goal of understanding your codebase and building independently. Good luck!
