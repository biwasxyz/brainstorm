Direct Answer

Understanding Your Current Codebase

To understand your existing Next.js frontend codebase, start by reviewing its file structure and main components. Spend the first 10 days identifying how data is fetched, state is managed, and components interact. Try making small changes to see how the app responds, and use documentation like [Next.js Docs](https://nextjs.org/docs) to clarify doubts. This will help you move away from relying on AI for edits.

Learning Fundamentals and Building Skills

Focus on React/Next.js fundamentals first, including useState, useEffect, and other hooks, as these are essential for dynamic updates in your app. Since you use Tailwind CSS, learn how to style components efficiently. Then, dive into Typescript for type safety, followed by FastAPI for backend development and LangChain for AI agents. For your SAAS, you'll need to learn how to fetch news via APIs, summarize with AI, send emails, and post on X using its API.

SAAS Development Plan

Your SAAS idea—an agentic platform for daily company news summaries via email and X posts after market close—requires integrating these technologies. Plan to spend weeks 3-5 learning FastAPI, email services like Sendgrid, and the X API. Start with a simple prototype by week 6, extending beyond 30 days if needed, given your 4-hour daily study window after college (6-10 am).

Time Management and Soft Skills

With college from 6-10 am and work starting around 11:30 am, allocate 4 hours daily for learning and SAAS planning. Include 30 minutes daily for writing about your progress and weekly video tutorials to build soft skills. Maintain small atomic habits, like reviewing notes daily, to stay consistent.

Expected Timeline and Mastery

Given the complexity, you likely won’t master everything in 30 days but can achieve a solid understanding of your codebase and make significant progress on your SAAS. Consider extending the timeline for full implementation, focusing first on understanding and then building.

Survey Note: Detailed Plan for Learning and SAAS Development

This detailed plan addresses your goals of understanding your current Next.js codebase, building a SAAS application, and developing fundamental programming skills, while balancing your college schedule, work, and health. It incorporates your technologies (Next.js, Typescript, FastAPI, LangGraph/LangChain, Tailwind CSS) and includes soft skills like article writing, speaking, and video tutorials.

Background and Context

You’ve been programming for 2.5 years, primarily using AI to write code, with projects in Next.js, Supabase, LangGraph/LangChain, and FastAPI. You’ve completed projects by following tutorials and copying code, but lack fundamental knowledge and problem-solving skills, struggling with basic interview questions. Your goal is to understand your current codebase, build a SAAS providing daily company news summaries via email and X posts, and launch it, all while learning the tech stack deeply.

Given your schedule—college from 6-10 am, work starting around 11:30 am, and 4 hours daily for learning—this plan is designed to fit within your constraints, with an emphasis on gradual progress and health maintenance.

Detailed Learning Objectives

To achieve your goals, you’ll need to master several areas:

1. React/Next.js Fundamentals:
    
    - Key concepts include components, props, state, and lifecycle methods, with a focus on hooks like useState, useEffect, and others for dynamic updates. Since you use Tailwind CSS, learn how to style components efficiently for responsive design.
        
    - Resources: [Next.js Docs](https://nextjs.org/docs), [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs).
        
2. Typescript Integration:
    
    - Learn type annotations, interfaces, and how to use Typescript with React/Next.js for type safety. Practice converting existing code to Typescript to reinforce learning.
        
    - Resources: [Typescript Docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs).
        
3. FastAPI for Backend:
    
    - Understand how to build RESTful APIs, handle requests/responses, and integrate with databases if needed. This is crucial for your SAAS backend.
        
    - Resources: [FastAPI Docs](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).
        
4. LangGraph/LangChain for AI Agents:
    
    - Learn how to use LangChain for building AI agents, particularly for news summarization. LangGraph, a related tool, may also be explored for graph-based AI tasks.
        
    - Resources: [LangChain Docs](https://docs.langchain.com/).
        
5. Additional SAAS Requirements:
    
    - News Fetching: Use news APIs like News API ([News API](https://newsapi.org/)) to fetch company-specific news. Learn web scraping if APIs are insufficient.
        
    - Email Sending: Integrate services like Sendgrid or Mailgun for automated email summaries.
        
    - X API Integration: Use the X Developer Platform ([X Dev Platform](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)) to post summaries after market close, ensuring compliance with API terms.
        
6. Deployment:
    
    - Deploy Next.js on Vercel and FastAPI on Digital Ocean, ensuring scalability for your SAAS.
        

30-Day Schedule with Daily Breakdown

Given 4 hours daily from 11:30 am to 3:30 pm, here’s a structured schedule:

| Week   | Days  | Focus Area                               | Daily Activities                                                                | Soft Skills (30 min daily)         |
| ------ | ----- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Week 1 | 1-7   | Understand Current Codebase              | Review structure, analyze components, identify confusion, resolve questions     | Write learning notes               |
| Week 2 | 8-14  | React/Next.js Fundamentals               | Learn components, hooks, routing, build small app, review                       | Weekly video tutorial, write notes |
| Week 3 | 15-21 | Typescript with React/Next.js, News APIs | Study Typescript, practice conversion, learn news API usage                     | Practice speaking, write notes     |
| Week 4 | 22-28 | FastAPI, Email Sending                   | Set up FastAPI, create endpoints, learn email integration, review               | Weekly video tutorial, write notes |
| Week 5 | 29-30 | LangChain, X API                         | Learn LangChain for summarization, explore X API for posting, plan SAAS further | Write notes, practice speaking     |

Daily Schedule Example:

- 11:30 am - 12:30 pm: Learning session (e.g., React tutorial, FastAPI setup).
    
- 12:30 pm - 1:30 pm: Codebase review or practice project.
    
- 1:30 pm - 2:00 pm: Soft skills (writing, speaking, or video recording).
    
- 2:00 pm - 3:30 pm: SAAS planning or reviewing material.
    

SAAS Application Design

Your SAAS will be an agentic platform providing:

- Daily research and summaries of company news via email.
    
- Automatic X posts after market close summarizing NEPSE Alpha news.
    

Key Features:

- User subscription management (store email, company preferences).
    
- News fetching via APIs, summarized using LangChain.
    
- Scheduled email sending and X posting.
    

Implementation Steps (Post-30 Days):

1. Set up backend with FastAPI for user management and news processing.
    
2. Integrate LangChain for AI summarization.
    
3. Configure email services and X API for automated tasks.
    
4. Build frontend with Next.js for user interaction, styled with Tailwind CSS.
    

Given the 30-day timeline, focus on planning and learning; implementation may extend beyond, which is expected given the complexity.

Soft Skills and Atomic Habits

- Article Writing: Write daily notes on learnings, aiming for weekly blog posts by week 4.
    
- Speaking: Practice explaining concepts aloud twice weekly, recording for self-review.
    
- Video Tutorials: Record one short video weekly, starting with React basics, progressing to FastAPI.
    
- Atomic Habits: Review notes daily, set small goals (e.g., understand one component daily), and maintain consistency.
    

Health and Time Management

With college from 6-10 am and work starting at 11:30 am, ensure you eat and rest adequately. The 4-hour study window is tight, so prioritize sleep and avoid burnout. Adjust the schedule if needed, extending the timeline for SAAS launch if necessary.

Expected Outcomes

By day 30, you’ll likely have:

- A deep understanding of your current Next.js codebase, able to make changes without AI.
    
- Solid fundamentals in React/Next.js, Typescript, FastAPI, and basics of LangChain.
    
- A planned SAAS architecture, with potential for a prototype by week 6.
    
- Improved soft skills through writing, speaking, and video creation.
    

This plan is ambitious but achievable with discipline, and extending beyond 30 days for full SAAS implementation is reasonable.
